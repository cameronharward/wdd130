    <h2>Cameron Harward</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Cameron Harward and I am pursuing a computer science degree.
        I hope to one day be either a software engineer or a game developer.
    </p>
    <p>I just moved here from Caldwell, Idaho. So not that much of a distance compared to some. 
        So far, my favorite part about being here is the amazing campus and the fantastic after schools activites. I see
        web design as a large pillar in almost any career really, because most everything we do is online, and the extra experience in web design
        might help me get more hiring opportunities.
    </p>
    <p> I have been a member of the church for my whole life and my favorite scripture is 1st Nephi chapter 3 verse 7,"And it came to pass that I 
        Nephi sad unto my father, I will go and do the things that Heavenly Father commandeth me, for I know the Lord giveth no commndment unto the 
        children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them to accomplish the things which he hath commandeth them."
    </p>
