            <p>Shortly after Hollow Knight released it's last unpaid dlc, Team Cherry announced new paid dlc for their game. In this expansion, you play as a different character in the game. Team Cherry ended up overestimating how large the project was going to be, and instead announced that Hollow Knight:Silksong would be it's own video game. Unfortunately, the game was announced in early 2019, almost 5 years ago now. Which did irreplible damage to the game's online community.</p>

                Before the game was accounced, the community was very normal, very similar to any other game community. They would post their accomplishments in game, develop strategies for difficult encounters, and post silly memes about the events of the game. Everything changed after Silksong was announced. The whole community would constantly make posts trying to predict when the game would come out. They would constantly stalk video game events and shows and spam their live chats with some varation or just the word,"Silksong".

                Year after year, the community would go more and more insane waiting for the sequel to their favorite game. These days, the hype around the game has really died down. People don't get excited about it anymore. And still, the game has not released. Although, many have hope for a 2024 release. Team Cherry had announced before that Silksong was going to come out earlier this year. But who knows at this point.
