      <p>
        Hollow Knight is a 2D metriodvania made by Team Cherry. It is brought to life with a hand-drawn artstyle.
        The game also includes souls-like mechanics,(which means when you die you leave behind all the currency you were holding
        at the time). That's all well and good, but those descriptions don't really sau much about the game. So what makes it so good?

        Hollow Knight's combat is simple. You press the attack button, and your character swings their sword or "nail" in the direction
        that you face. Hitting enemies fills up your mana or "soul" which allows you to cast spells as well. There is more ways to go on
        the offensive but those actions will make up the majority of your playthrough. So where is the depth? It comes from enemy interactions.
        Every enemy in the game has a different attack timing, pattern, and movement, so the complexity comes from your ability to dodge and
        weave through the chaos to land strikes on your opponent. The game features difficult bossfights, but the most difficult encounters are
        completely optional. This allows players of all skill levels to enjoy the game without forcing them into an unwinnable battle.

        What else is in store in the world of Hollow Knight? Well, it is a metroidvania. The explorable areas in the game starts small at the start,
        but as you progress you can unlock more and more abilities that open up more areas to explore. Despite this, the path to the end is not
        a straight line. Every playthrough can be different. Beyond the metriodvania elements, exploring the world of Hollow Knight is a joy.
        Every area in the game eminates a strong atmosphere, which each area being very unique. There are new things to see or unlock around
        every corner, so exploration is highly encouraged.

        Last, but most assuredly not least, the music. Hollow Knight's soundtrack was composed by Christopher Larkin. It elevates every single
        aspect of the game. The combat, exploration, and boss battles would not be the same without Christopher Larkin's masterful music. Part
        of the identity of Hollow Knight is it's beautiful music.

        So go play Hollow Knight. If you don't, you will miss out on a magical experience.

      <h3>History of Hollow Knight</h3>
      <p>
        9 years ago, in 2014, Team Cherry created a game for a game jam(a timed video game creation competition) called Hungry Knight. The titular character of the game
        shares the exact same design as the future Hollow Knight player character. The game wasn't particularly good, being a simple top down slasher with the 
        goal of finding apples to eat. But something about the game gave Team Cherry inspiration for their next real game. 

        In that same year, Team Cherry launched their kickstarter for Hollow Knight. The charm of the game managed to win over many people's hearts, and most 
        importantly, their wallets. Team Cherry managed to fund over 57,000 dollars for their game. Finally, Hollow Knight released February 24, 2017. It recieved postive
        critical response, and built up a solid online community. Team Cherry even managed to release 4 unpaid dlcs for the game as well.

      </ul>
      <h3>Community and Sequel</h3>
      <p>
          Shortly after Hollow Knight released it's last unpaid dlc, Team Cherry announced new paid dlc for their game. In this expansion, you play as a different character
          in the game. Team Cherry ended up overestimating how large the project was going to be, and instead announced that Hollow Knight:Silksong would be it's own video game.
          Unfortunately, the game was announced in early 2019, almost 5 years ago now. Which did irreplible damage to the game's online community.

          Before the game was accounced, the community was very normal, very similar to any other game community. They would post their accomplishments in game, develop strategies
          for difficult encounters, and post silly memes about the events of the game. Everything changed after Silksong was announced. The whole community would constantly make posts
          trying to predict when the game would come out. They would constantly stalk video game events and shows and spam their live chats with some varation or just the word,"Silksong".
          Year after year, the community would go more and more insane waiting for the sequel to their favorite game. These days, the hype around the game has really died down. People don't
          get excited about it anymore. And still, the game has not released. Although, many have hope for a 2024 release. Team Cherry had announced before that Silksong was going to come out
          earlier this year. But who knows at this point.
