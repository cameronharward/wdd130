            <p>Hollow Knight is a 2D metriodvania made by Team Cherry. It is brought to life with a hand-drawn artstyle. The game also includes souls-like mechanics,(which means when you die you leave behind all the currency you were holding at the time). That's all well and good, but those descriptions don't really sau much about the game. So what makes it so good? Hollow Knight's combat is simple. You press the attack button, and your character swings their sword or "nail" in the direction that you face. Hitting enemies fills up your mana or "soul" which allows you to cast spells as well.</p>

            <p id = "middle"> There is more ways to go on the offensive but those actions will make up the majority of your playthrough. So where is the depth? It comes from enemy interactions. Every enemy in the game has a different attack timing, pattern, and movement, so the complexity comes from your ability to dodge and weave through the chaos to land strikes on your opponent. The game features difficult bossfights, but the most difficult encounters are completely optional. This allows players of all skill levels to enjoy the game without forcing them into an unwinnable battle. What else is in store in the world of Hollow Knight? Well, it is a metroidvania.The explorable areas in the game starts small at the start, but as you progress you can unlock more and more abilities that open up more areas to explore. </p>

            <p>Despite this, the path to the end is not a straight line. Every playthrough can be different. Beyond the metriodvania elements, exploring the world of Hollow Knight is a joy. Every area in the game eminates a strong atmosphere, which each area being very unique. There are new things to see or unlock around every corner, so exploration is highly encouraged. Last, but most assuredly not least, the music. Hollow Knight's soundtrack was composed by Christopher Larkin. It elevates every single aspect of the game. The combat, exploration, and boss battles would not be the same without Christopher Larkin's masterful music. Part of the identity of Hollow Knight is it's beautiful music. </p>
