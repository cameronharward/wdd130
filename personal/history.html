                <p>9 years ago, in 2014, Team Cherry created a game for a game jam(a timed video game creation competition) called Hungry Knight. The titular character of the game shares the exact same design as the future Hollow Knight player character. The game wasn't particularly good, being a simple top down slasher with the goal of finding apples to eat. But something about the game gave Team Cherry inspiration for their next real game. In that same year, Team Cherry launched their kickstarter for Hollow Knight.</p>

                <p>The charm of the game managed to win over many people's hearts, and most importantly, their wallets. Team Cherry managed to fund over 57,000 dollars for their game, with the promise of even more content that they promised on their fund goal sheet. Finally, Hollow Knight released February 24, 2017. It recieved postive critical aclaim, and built up a solid online community. It quickly became one of the most popular indie games in the market. The game set a new standard for what could be achieved in game development with only a small team and some funding.</p>
                <p>Team Cherry even managed to release 4 unpaid dlcs for the game as well over the course of the next year. Each dlc Team Cherry created added more and more content into the game including new areas, boss fights, items and even endings to the game. The first dlc they released was Hidden Dreams, which added some boss battles and items into the game that revolved around the dream nail mechanic. Next was "The Grimm Troupe" which added a side quest that included two new boss battles that are beloved by players. Afterwards, "Lifeblood" released, and it mainly fixed many technical issues the game had had since release. It also added one boss battle as well. The last dlc to release was "Godmaster", which introduced a new gamemode, area, boss rush with new bosses included, and two new endings.</p>
